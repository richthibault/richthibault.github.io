After three years, the app was getting a bit stale.  Changes to the Swift language were causing performance issues, so I migrated to Swift 5 and improved the networking calls.  It also needed some cosmetic upgrades to look better on iPhone XR, iPad, etc.  Looking much better and running super fast.

Still the fastest way to throw a link from Google Chrome to your iOS device!  Check out LinkThrow 1.2 for iOS here:
