Hello! I am a full-stack developer creating enterprise applications that boost innovation and growth. I specialize in Java, Spring, and AI-driven integrations to build elegant, scalable, and modern solutions.

My skills include software design and development, database design, and mobile app development for both iOS and Android. I also design and build RESTful APIs, and have experience with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. Additionally, I design and build front ends using Thymeleaf, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

I'm the president and founder of <a href="https://www.exquisiteloop.com" target="_blank">Exquisite Loop, LLC</a>, an Orlando-based consulting firm.
