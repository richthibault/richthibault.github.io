Hi, I'm Rich.  I've been in software development some 33 years, mostly building business
systems and e-commerce sites.  I do full-stack development, from database design to API
to front-end layout.  I work mostly in Java/Spring these days, though I still
do the occasional iOS or Android mobile app.

I've worked in many vertical markets, from real estate to e-learning to travel to construction.

I've also visited many horizontal markets, like Publix, and the night market in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
